Developed a basic banking system starting with the home page which displays the checking balance and savings balance which is to be entered by the user. After entering the checking and savings balance, the web page redirects the user to the page where the user can carry out the transactions to be performed such as - debit, deposit, withdraw and transfer. A detailed description of the transaction type, description, amount and current balance is displayed below the checking account and savings account sections as soon as the user clicks on the 'Submit' button in the respective sections.
